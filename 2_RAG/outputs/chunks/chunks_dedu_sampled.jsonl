As an example, this guide will go through the steps to deploy [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for text classification. \n\n## 1. Enter the Hugging Face Repository ID and your desired endpoint name:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_repository.png\" alt=\"select repository\" />\n\n## 2. Select your Cloud Provider and region. Initially, only AWS will be available as a Cloud Provider with the `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1` regions. We will add Azure soon, and if you need to test Endpoints with other Cloud Providers or regions, please let us know.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_region.png\" alt=\"select region\" />\n\n## 3. Define the [Security Level](security) for the Endpoint:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_security.png\" alt=\"define security\" />\n\n## 4. Create your Endpoint by clicking **Create Endpoint**. By default, your Endpoint is created with a medium CPU (2 x 4GB vCPUs with Intel Xeon Ice Lake) The cost estimate assumes the Endpoint will be up for an entire month, and does not take autoscaling into account.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_create_cost.png\" alt=\"create endpoint\" />\n\n## 5. Wait for the Endpoint to build, initialize and run which can take between 1 to 5 minutes.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/overview.png\" alt=\"overview\" />\n\n## 6. Test your Endpoint in the overview with the Inference widget 🏁 🎉!", "source": "huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/blob/main/docs/source/guides/create_endpoint.mdx", "start_index": 1}

{"id": 2, "text": "Choosing a metric for your task\n\n**So you've trained your model and want to see how well it’s doing on a dataset of your choice. Where do you start?**\n\nThere is no “one size fits all” approach to choosing an evaluation metric, but some good guidelines to keep in mind are:\n\n## Categories of metrics\n\nThere are 3 high-level categories of metrics:\n\n1. *Generic metrics*, which can be applied to a variety of situations and datasets, such as precision and accuracy.\n2. *Task-specific metrics*, which are limited to a given task, such as Machine Translation (often evaluated using metrics [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) or [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge)) or Named Entity Recognition (often evaluated with [seqeval](https://huggingface.co/metrics/seqeval)).\n3. *Dataset-specific metrics*, which aim to measure model performance on specific benchmarks: for instance, the [GLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) has a dedicated [evaluation metric](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue).\n\nLet's look at each of these three cases:\n\n### Generic metrics\n\nMany of the metrics used in the Machine Learning community are quite generic and can be applied in a variety of tasks and datasets.\n\nThis is the case for metrics like [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) and [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), which can be used for evaluating labeled (supervised) datasets, as well as [perplexity](https://huggingface.co/metrics/perplexity), which can be used for evaluating different kinds of (unsupervised) generative tasks.\n\nTo see the input structure of a given metric, you can look at its metric card. For example, in the case of [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), the format is:\n```\n>>> precision_metric = evaluate.load(\"precision\")\n>>> results = precision_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])\n>>> print(results)\n{'precision': 1.0}\n```\n\n### Task-specific metrics", "source": "huggingface/evaluate/blob/main/docs/source/choosing_a_metric.mdx", "start_index": 1}
